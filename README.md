## Description:

I have known beforehand how to do most of the techniques and skills learned in this course, but two things stood out as being completely new to me, those being flexbox and adding a proper **Contact Me** page. Flexbox allows the user to make sites completely viewable and accessible on any device, something I have never heard of before. However, when it was presented in the course, it made sense to me, as nowadays mobile sites are styled slightly differently than desktop sites. I never understood how **Contact Me** pages were created when interacting with websites, but learning that it's a relatively simple thing to do, and only involves a few lines of code absolutely blew my mind.

## Color Scheme

I wanted a color scheme that looked a little jarring upon first glance, as in my experience, it tends to catch the user's attention. However, making it **too** jarring would lead to the user not wanting to interact with the page any farther. The two most vivid and "in your face" colors on my page were the harsh dark green background (#0B943F) and blood-red text (#940700).
