            <h2>An Excerpt From Pride and Prejudice</h2>

            <div>

                <p>“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It would be nothing; I could
                    see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My
                    mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says.
                    Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”</p>

                <p>“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it is wholly out of my power.
                    You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me,
                    because you have always so much.”</p>

                <p>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest
                    tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could.
                    She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing
                    him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her
                    dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.</p>

                <p>Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table;
                    but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him,
                    and sat down again by her sister.</p>

                <p>“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”</p>

                <p>“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know.”</p>
